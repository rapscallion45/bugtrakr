# BUGTRAKR - Front end bug tracking SPA

BugTrakr is a simple bug/issue tracking SPA built with TypeScript, NextJS and Redux. It has been styled with MUI v5 and is tested with React Testing Library.

This application allows users to add their projects and track bugs/issues within those projects, allowing project and bug creation, updates and deletion. Bugs can have different priority levels and can be opened, reopened and closed. Different users can also be assigned and removed to each project, thus giving a level of privacy to the system.
